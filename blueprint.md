# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the style, design, and features of the SmartSpend application. It serves as a single source of truth for the application's current state and future development.

## Style and Design

- **Theme:** The application uses a modern, clean design with both light and dark modes.
- **Typography:** The `inter` font from Google Fonts is used throughout the application.
- **Color Scheme:** The primary color is deep purple, with a light grey background in light mode and a dark grey background in dark mode.

## Features

### Core Features

- **Transaction Management:** Users can add, edit, and delete income and expense transactions.
- **Account Management:** Users can create and manage multiple accounts (e.g., cash, bank, credit card).
- **Budgeting:** Users can set monthly budgets for different categories and track their spending against those budgets.
- **Reporting:** The application provides various reports, including monthly and yearly overviews, expense reports, and bazar reports.

### Lending Manager

- **Lending and Repayment Tracking:** The lending manager allows users to track money they have lent to others and repayments they have received. This feature is integrated with the main transaction list, so all financial activities are in one place.
- **Contact Management:** Users can add and manage contacts for lending and borrowing.
- **Net Balance:** The lending manager displays the net balance for each contact, so users always know the outstanding amount.

## Current Plan

- Added back functionality to the monthly and yearly overview screens.
